Main uncertainties (2011, 2012/52X)

The JEC uncertainties are grouped together in a way that makes the correlations transparent. The absolute scale is a single fixed number, hence the absolute scale uncertainty is fully correlated across pT and eta. However, the MC prediction of the pT dependence may be off so extra uncertainties based on Pythia and Herwig differences as well as single particles response is assigned for high and low pT extrapolation. The L2 correction is only a function of eta, and hence fully correlated across pT. The various detector regions are generally strongly correlated within themselves, and thus the L2 sources are only provided for wide regions: barrel, endcap within tracking, endcap outside tracking, and HF. The L1 uncertainty and jet flavor uncertainties are only important at low pT, and the sources strive to cover the possible variations in shape vs pT and eta.

The full list of uncertainty sources currently accessible is listed below:

    Absolute : absolute scale uncertainty. Mainly uncertainty in combined photon (EM) and Z->mumu (tracking) reference scale and correction for FSR+ISR.
    HighPtExtra : high pT extrapolation. Based on Pythia6 Z2/Herwig++2.3 differences in fragmentation and underlying event (FullSim).
    SinglePion : high pT extrapolation. Based on propagation of +/-3% variation in single particle response to PF Jets (FastSim).
    Flavor : jet flavor (quark/gluon/charm/b-jet). Based on Pythia6 Z2/Herwig++2.3 differences in quark and gluon responses relative to QCD mixture (charm and b-jets are in betweed uds and g).
    Time : JEC time dependence. Observed instability in the endcap region, presumed to be due to the EM laser correction instability for prompt 42X data.
    RelativeJER[EC1][EC2][HF] : eta-dependence uncertainty from jet pT resolution (JER). The JER uncertainties are assumed fully correlated for endcap within tracking (EC1), endcap outside tracking (EC2) and hadronic forward (HF).
    RelativeFSR : eta-dependence uncertainty due to correction for final state radiation. Uncertainty increases toward HF, but is correlated from one region to the other.
    RelativeStat[EC2][HF] : statistical uncertainty in determination of eta-dependence. Averaged out over wider detector regions, and only important in endcap outside tracking (EC2) and in HF.
    PileUp[DataMC][OOT][Pt][Bias][JetRate] : uncertainties for pile-up corrections. The [DataMC] parameterizes data/MC differences vs eta in Zero Bias data. The OOT estimates residual out-of-time pile-up for prescaled triggers, if reweighing MC to unprescaled data. The [Pt] covers for the offset dependence on jet pT (due to e.g. zero suppression effects), when the correction is calibrated for jets in the pT=20-30 GeV range. The [Bias] covers for the differences in measured offset from Zero Bias (neutrino gun) MC and from MC truth in the QCD sample, which is not yet fully understood. The [JetRate] covers for observed jet rate variation versus <Nvtx> in 2011 single jet triggers, after applying L1 corrections. 

The following uncertainties are not sources, but quadratic sums of subsets of sources described above. Their main purpose is to facilitate the uncertainty studies and cross-check the totals.

    SubTotalPileUp: sum of pile-up uncertainties (PileUp[*])
    SubTotalRelative: eta-dependence uncertainties (Relative[*])
    SubTotalPt: high/low pT extrapolation (Absolute, HighPtExtra, SinglePion, Flavor)
    SubTotalDataMC: sum of all uncertainties in which Data to MC ratios are considered on the full 4.7/fb sample. This includes all uncertainty sources except PileUpPt, PileUpBias and Time.
    Total : sum of all uncertainties in quadrature



2012 JEC
New uncertainty sources for 53X Summer13_V1 JEC (20/fb at 8 TeV in 2012, using full 2012 re-reco)

    Summer13_V4_Uncertainties.tgz: archive for new total uncertainties and uncertainty sources 

NB: This new uncertainty files contains updates to the JetFlavor systematics. They contain a extra set of uncertainties which allow for a better flavor treatment that will reduce uncertainties for pure uds, b and c flavors as well as for the QCD and Z/gamma+jet mixtures. FlavorQCD is used for the flavor uncertainty in the total uncertainty.

Old uncertainty sources for 53X Fall12_V5 JEC (11/fb at 8 TeV in 2012, using 2012A+B re-reco, 2012C prompt reco):

    FALL12_V7_Uncertainties.tgz: archive for new total uncertainties and uncertainty sources 

We had identified a problem with PileUpBias source having a runaway behavior at low pT for the first set to uncertainty files. The archive file contains newer total uncertainties than in the current global tag. Please use these new uncertainty files consistently!:

NB: Don't let the V7 in the name bother you, this is internal numbering and refers to Fall12_V5. Note that the Fall12_V7_DATA_UncertaintySources_AK5PFchs.txt file is for small cone size with CHS, meant for most analyses, while Fall12_V7_DATA_UncertaintySources_AK7PF.txt is for large cone size without CHS, targeted for QCD. We have not produced all the other variants to avoid confusion; let us (hn-cms-jes) know if you have a valid user case and these can be added later.

Old uncertainty sources for the first 2012 JEC with 1.6/fb of 52X data at sqrt(s)=8 TeV:

    Summer12_V2_DATA_AK5PF_UncertaintySources.txt: Uncertainty sources for 2012 52X data (AK5PF)
    Summer12_V2_DATA_AK7PF_UncertaintySources.txt: Uncertainty sources for 2012 52X data (AK7PF) 

These files contain the Data/MC ratio uncertainty for the full 4.7/fb sample to be used e.g. with type-I MET uncertainty (SubTotalDataMC instead of Total):

    JEC11_V12_UncertaintyDataMC_AK5PF.txt: SubTotalDataMC for AK5PF as a single uncertainty file
    JEC11_V12_UncertaintyDataMC_AK7PF.txt: SubTotalDataMC for AK7PF as a single uncertainty file 

Caveat: be extra careful, because the time dependence systematic is completely removed.

These files contain the Data/MC ratio uncertainty for the 1.6/fb sample in 52X:

    Summer12_V2_DATA_AK5PF_UncertaintyDataMC.txt: SubTotalDataMC for AK5PF as a single uncertainty file
    Summer12_V2_DATA_AK7PF_UncertaintyDataMC.txt: SubTotalDataMC for AK7PF as a single uncertainty file
